//3a) Give the array it's own file 

let myCollection = [
    {
      name: "School of Code mug",
      count: 1,
      whatILike: "It has my cute pixel character on it!"
    },
    {
      name: "School of Code hat",
      count: 2,
      whatILike: "An often overlooked fashion accessory"
    },
    {
      name: "School of Code pillow",
      count: 1,
      whatILike: "Eat. Sleep. Code. Repeat :)"
    }
  ];

  //3b) Change the package.json so it has the property type: module
  export default myCollection;
